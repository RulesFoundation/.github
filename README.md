# The Axiom Foundation

**The world's rules, encoded.**

Axiom builds open, machine-readable encodings of statutes, regulations, and
policy rules. The durable surface is RuleSpec YAML plus normalized law data; the
tooling is designed for transparent review, deterministic tests, and compiler
validation.

## Core Projects

| Project | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [axiom-foundation.org](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/axiom-foundation.org) | Axiom website and app for navigating encoded law. |
| [axiom-rules-engine](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/axiom-rules-engine) | RuleSpec compiler and runtime. |
| [axiom-encode](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/axiom-encode) | AI-assisted RuleSpec encoding and validation tooling. |
| [axiom-scrapers](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/axiom-scrapers) | Ingestion tooling for collecting and normalizing legal source text. |

## Rule Repositories

| Repo | Coverage |
| --- | --- |
| [rulespec-us](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/rulespec-us) | United States federal rules. |
| [rulespec-us-ca](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/rulespec-us-ca) | California rules. |
| [rulespec-us-ny](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/rulespec-us-ny) | New York rules. |
| [rulespec-ca](https://github.com/TheAxiomFoundation/rulespec-ca) | Canada rules. |

## Shared CI

Jurisdiction rule repositories should keep a small local `validate` workflow that
calls the centralized reusable workflow in this repository:

```yaml
jobs:
  validate:
    uses: TheAxiomFoundation/.github/.github/workflows/validate-rulespec.yml@main
```

By default, the workflow validates RuleSpec YAML under `statutes/`,
`regulations/`, and `policies/`.

The workflow rejects singular rule roots, separate parameter or test fixture
files, YAML fixtures under `tests/`, non-RuleSpec YAML outside the approved
roots, obsolete generated formula artifacts, manual RuleSpec YAML edits without
a signed `axiom-encode --apply` manifest, and unclassified PolicyEngine oracle
coverage. Rules repos using this workflow need the
`AXIOM_ENCODE_APPLY_SIGNING_KEY` secret. New executable outputs must either have
an exact PolicyEngine mapping or a harness-side `not_comparable` classification
with a rationale.
